# Borrow

### Why borrow from TrueFi?

Whitelisted borrowers can borrow without collateral. Most DeFi lending platforms that exist today can provide overcollateralized loans. By borrowing capital and repaying loans on time, borrowers build trust with TRU holders and position themselves to obtain larger loans and lower interest rates from the protocol moving forward.

**As a first step, feel free to reach out to ‘@ryanrodenbaugh’ on Telegram who will be able to assist you with the process.**

### How do I apply to become a borrower on TrueFi?

Currently, we only allow institutional borrowers to borrow on the TrueFi platform. As we head down the path of progressive decentralization, we will continue to iterate on the borrower onboarding process. The current onboarding process is as follows:

1. Complete [KYC/AML check](https://app.trusttoken.com/choose-account-type). When asked for the purpose of your account, please select Other and check the box for Applying as a TrueFi Borrower.
2. Sign a Master Loan Agreement. Ryan will be able to send this to you once you provide him your email address.
3. Complete a financial review.  Ryan will be able to send this to you once you provide him your email address.
4. Make a post on the TrueFi Forum providing information about their fund. Here is some [example text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bRtFgfRrlUear-f6Rz7_18i-1pbPRkpxr-x6ubOaB24/edit) with all the details we recommend you include in your own introductory post. You can also look at posts from [previous borrowers](https://forum.truefi.io/c/borrower-requests/5) for examples. Do not include information about rates and amount you wish to borrow that will be calculated based on the diligence materials you provide and will be provided to you at completion of the steps above.
5. Once all the above steps are completed, we will whitelist your Ethereum address that you provided in Step 2.
6. At this point, everything else going forward happens on-chain and will require you to use Metamask or a custodial wallet to interact with our smart contracts. You will now post the loan on the TrueFi platform \(app.truefi.io/borrow -- only visible once your ETH address is whitelisted\), where TrueFi stakers will stake for, or against, the loan. If enough TRU are staked for the loan, the borrower will be able to withdraw funds after 72-hours.

Steps 1, 2 and 3 can happen in parallel. 

### How do I create loan applications? 

You can create loan applications by visiting the [TrueFi app](https://app.truefi.io/) after successful onboarding and address whitelisting. You will then need to connect the whitelisted ETH address via MetaMask. Once you are connected, you will see the [Borrow](http://app.truefi.io/borrow) tab in the menu. Click on this tab and you’ll be brought to the Borrow page where you can select Apply for a new loan.

### How do loans get approved?

### How do I withdraw once a loan has been approved?

Head to the [Borrow](http://app.truefi.io/borrow) tab in the TrueFi app. Navigate to the loan you wish to fund and click Fund. After the loan is funded, you can withdraw the loan amount to your wallet by clicking Withdraw.

### How do I repay the loan application? 

Head to the [Borrow](http://app.truefi.io/borrow) tab in the TrueFi app and click Repay on the respective loan. Click on Max to view the total amount due and complete the transaction.
