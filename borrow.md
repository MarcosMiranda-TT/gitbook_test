# Borrow

### Why borrow from TrueFi?

Whitelisted borrowers can borrow without collateral. Most DeFi lending platforms that exist today can provide overcollateralized loans. By borrowing capital and repaying loans on time, borrowers build trust with TRU holders and position themselves to obtain larger loans and lower interest rates from the protocol moving forward.

### How do I apply to become a borrower on TrueFi?

Currently, we only allow institutional borrowers to borrow on the TrueFi platform. As we head down the path of progressive decentralization, we will continue to iterate on the borrower onboarding process. The current onboarding process is as follows:

1. Complete **TrueTrading’s** [KYC/AML](https://app.trusttoken.com/choose-account-type) check. When asked for the purpose of your account, please select Other and check the box for Applying as a TrueFi Borrower.
2. Once the KYC/AML process is complete, the borrower makes a post on the [TrueFi Forum](https://forum.truefi.io/) providing information about their fund. Here is some [example text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bRtFgfRrlUear-f6Rz7_18i-1pbPRkpxr-x6ubOaB24/edit?usp=sharing) with all the details we recommend you include in your own introductory post. 

   Since governance is yet to be implemented in its final form, this introductory post is simply intended to provide more information for potential stakers and lenders.

3. If the reception on the forum is generally positive and clarifying questions receive relevant and timely responses, the borrower will then be offered to sign a Master Loan Agreement.

   From a legal perspective, what is happening in this first pool is, lenders are lending TrueUSD to TrustToken, Inc. Then, TrustToken, Inc. lends TrueUSD to borrowers. \(While from a more technical perspective, this is all happening programmatically and on-chain.\)

4. The borrower provides TrustToken, Inc. an ETH address to whitelist for borrowing.
5. The borrower posts the loan on the TrueFi platform, where TrueFi stakers will stake for, or against, the loan. If enough TRU are staked for the loan, the borrower will be able to withdraw funds.

### How do I create loan applications? 

You can create loan applications by visiting the [TrueFi app](https://app.truefi.io/) after successful onboarding and address whitelisting. You will then need to connect the whitelisted ETH address via MetaMask. Once you are connected, you will see the [Borrow](http://app.truefi.io/borrow) tab in the menu. Click on this tab and you’ll be brought to the Borrow page where you can select Apply for a new loan.
