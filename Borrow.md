# Borrow

### Why borrow from TrueFi?

Whitelisted borrowers can borrow without collateral. Most DeFi lending platforms that exist today can provide over collateralized loans. By borrowing capital and repaying loans on time, borrowers build trust with TRU holders and position themselves to obtain larger loans and lower interest rates from the protocol moving forward.

### How do I apply to become a borrower on TrueFi?

**Currently, we only allow institutional borrowers with at least $10 million in net unencumbered assets to borrow on the TrueFi platform.** As we head down the path of progressive decentralization, we will continue to iterate on the borrower onboarding process. The current onboarding process is as follows:

1. Complete [New Borrower Inquiry](https://truefi.io/borrow) form and let us know that you have interest in becoming a borrow on TrueFi.
2. Complete [KYC/AML check](https://app.trusttoken.com/choose-account-type). When asked for the purpose of your account, please select Other and check the box for Applying as a TrueFi Borrower.
3. Sign a Master Loan Agreement. Ryan will be able to send this to you once you provide him your email address.
4. Complete a credit review.  Ryan will be able to send this to you once you provide him your email address.
5. Make a post on the TrueFi Forum providing information about their fund. Here is some [example text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bRtFgfRrlUear-f6Rz7_18i-1pbPRkpxr-x6ubOaB24/edit) with all the details we recommend you include in your own introductory post. You can also look at posts from [previous borrowers](https://forum.truefi.io/c/borrower-requests/5) for examples. Do not include information about rates and amount you wish to borrow that will be calculated based on the diligence materials you provide and will be provided to you at completion of the steps above.
6. Once all the above steps are completed, we will whitelist your Ethereum address that you provided in Step 2.
7. At this point, everything else going forward happens on-chain and will require you to use Metamask or a custodial wallet to interact with our smart contracts. You will now post the loan on the TrueFi platform \(app.truefi.io/borrow -- only visible once your ETH address is whitelisted\), where TrueFi stakers will stake for, or against, the loan. If the loan is approved, the borrower will be able to withdraw funds. Please have a look at the [Loan Approval Process](loan-approval-process.md). 

Steps 2, 3 and 4 can happen in parallel. 

### **What is the credit review and how is it conducted?**

TrustToken conducts an analysis of the borrower to determine credit quality and ensure adequate credit support exists for the benefit of the protocol’s lenders. As TrueFi is an unsecured lending protocol, it is critically important to understand the financial capabilities of our borrowers both in a normal and stressed environment due to systemic fallout and/or exogenous shock. 

From a financial perspective, TrustToken is focused primarily on available liquidity in the form of unencumbered liquid assets and collateral coverage that may range from 10.0 - 15.0x the total loan amount. It is required that the borrower present evidence to support this attestation in the form of financial statements or other similar documentation. In addition to these credit statistics, TrustToken will ask the borrower a range of qualitative questions that are equally important such as legal jurisdiction, hedging strategies, history of corporate restructurings and other critical inputs to the analysis. Together, this information will provide for an assessed credit score of between 0 – 255 where 0 would reflect an ineligible borrower and 255 would reflect a borrower that meets the highest level of the protocol’s credit standards. 

The borrower’s credit score would then be published on-chain and utilized to determine the final loan parameters including loan amount and interest rate. After the loan is funded, the borrower is required to maintain credit compliance during the term of the loan by periodically updating the analysis with TrustToken which may result in a credit score change and in the event of deteriorating financial condition an acceleration of the outstanding loan balance. TrustToken performs a good faith, equitable credit review bringing best-in-class borrowers to the protocol. _All information provided by the borrower for the purpose of this credit review remains strictly confidential and in the sole possession of TrustToken._

### How do I create loan applications? 

You can create loan applications by visiting the [TrueFi app](https://app.truefi.io/) after successful onboarding and address whitelisting. You will then need to connect the whitelisted ETH address via MetaMask. Once you are connected, you will see the [Borrow](http://app.truefi.io/borrow) tab in the menu. Click on this tab and you’ll be brought to the Borrow page where you can select Apply for a new loan.
