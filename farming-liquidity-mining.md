# Farm - Liquidity Mining

### What are the incentives for liquidity mining TRU? <a id="what-are-the-incentives-for-liquidity-mining-tru"></a>

To farm TRU by providing liquidity outside of TrueFi, LP tokens need to be staked in exchange for farm tokens. Holders of farm tokens can claim rewards in TRU as incentive for providing liquidity on external markets. These markets are:

* Uniswap ETH/TRU - This will incentivise TRU liquidity versus ETH. ETH holders can farm TRU using ETH with an upside to both.
* Uniswap TUSD/TFI - LP - This provides much needed liquidity for swapping pool tokens and TUSD. It may be very useful for pool token holders who need TUSD liquidity in/out of the pool. You can earn yield through TrueFi, uniswap fees, and TRU rewards.

You can start liquidity mining TRU on the Farm page. Check out our step-by-step video guide [**here**](https://www.loom.com/share/aed3a1a355e548989065fdd1fe771dd4).

### What is the distribution schedule of TRU for Liquidity Providers? <a id="what-is-the-distribution-schedule-of-tru-for-liquidity-providers"></a>

A total of 565,500,000 TRU will be distributed over the course of next 4 years. Out of which 20.5% have been reserved for DEX liquidity providers.

### What are the risks of participating in TrueFi farms? <a id="what-is-the-distribution-schedule-of-tru-for-liquidity-providers"></a>

**TFI-LP** - There is no additional risk associated with staking your TrueFi LP tokens. You are inherently exposed to borrower default risk as a depositor but there is no additional risk for staking TFI-LP tokens.  
  
**Uniswap ETH &lt;&gt; TRU** - Risk of impermanent loss and price exposure to ETH and TRU.  
  
**Uniswap TFI-LP &lt;&gt; TUSD** - Risk of minor impermanent loss due to price difference between TFI-LP and TUSD. As a holder of TFI-LP tokens these liquidity providers also inherit borrower default risk.
